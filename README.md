# LiSuN
A server-less, AWS cloud-based Library Supervising Network where user can easily find the intended book across all the libraries in the city. This system is centrally managed by the regional administrator who takes care of the availability of books in all libraries. The System keeps the record of complete information of a book; Book name, Author name, Publisher’s name,  Date of publication. This web application is hosted on AWS, it is safe from unpredicted failure and thus always be online because of AWS’s characteristic of keeping redundant copies of single instance in different availability zones
